# BAGCDUNIT2

This is a READ.ME file for **Charlie Hills**. Loads and loads of stuff happens here. Not a lot of it good. Created in 2004, the year before Rosa Parks died and the year after Tony Blair's illegal invasion of Iraq, this software exists at the intersection of cutting edge technological prowess and debilitatingly unfixable bugged out code.
<p> This code won't solve climate change, in fact it'll probably contribute to it. It won't find the answer to world hunger, it'll probably keep eating its way through the international crises we find ourselves in. Don't expect big things from this code, don't expect things at all. I mean, who are we to reduce the elements of an obselete software to a few lines of plain text? Who are we to burn cities to the ground and laugh in the face of impending disaster? Who are WE to exist temporally and criticise the ephemerality of digital design?
  
 <p> I don't know, I got carried away...
