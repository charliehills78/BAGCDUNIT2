This is a READ.ME file for **Charlie Hills**. Loads and loads of stuff happens here. Not a lot of it good. Created in 2004, the year before Rosa Parks died and the year after Tony Blair's illegal invasion of Iraq, this software exists at the intersection of cutting edge technological prowess and debilitatingly unfixable bugged out code.
